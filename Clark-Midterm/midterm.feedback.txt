Daniel,

Here is your feedback and grade breakdown by problems:

1) The experiments seem ok, except that you may not have given the perceptron
enough time to make progress after the linear regression starting point. What
if 100 wasn't enough? -1pt
Linear Regression does not change for this dataset, there is no average. - 1pt

2) Very good! 

3) No picture/drawing, except for a creepy-cool deep dream one. +1pt


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
